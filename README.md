What it does:

Our project analyzes the fuel economy of Toyota cars and compares them with other Toyota cars. This program creates a website and displays the fuel efficiency of different toyota cars over the past 5 years.

Inspiration:

The inspiration for our our project is our own personal experiences as commuter. Our entire group is made up of commuters who drive to and from college everyday. A major problem we face everyday is spending tons of money on gas. This is largely due to fuel inefficient cars, so when buying new cars, using the website we can look for the most fuel efficient car, saving money in the long term for commuters like us.

How we built it:

We built it by using Visual studio code and using multiple coding languages like html, java script, CSS, and python. Additionally we put the fuel economy data of the cars into firebase, and then transferring it into our back end in VS code. Later using that to build graphs in our front end code, and compare them with one another.

Challenges we ran into:

Challenges that we ran into is making our website function properly, which included making the graphs using code, making a drop down menu, and comparing the charts of cars between each other.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Accomplishment's that we are proud of is using a variety of coding languages to program our website, along with learning how to make graphs and drop down menu's in code. Along with learning how to vamp up the design of the website a little bit.

What we learned:

We learned how to use many coding languages together, and use visual studio code properly, which we didn't learn much of in our our coding classes, so much of what we did was self learned. We learned how to make different types of graphs using data from outside files.

What's next for Toyota Fuel Economy Comparison:

Our project can be very useful for people trying to shop car's, especially college students like us who are on a budget. Fuel Economy isn't talked about enough when buying a new car, but with out website, it becomes easier to decide which car is a better fit for people depending on it miles per gallon, because some people might need more than others, so this can definitely be used going forward.

Built With: css, firebase, html, javascript, python, Visual-studio
